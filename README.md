# Distracted-Driver-Detection
Project on detection of facial expressions using Haar classifiers introduced in Viola-Jones face detection algorithm.
If you plan to run the project then the files contained here need to be copied onto your opencv haarcascades folder. The project needs a virtual computer vision environment to run so install opencv, if you dont know how or what it is then go to this link : https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/06/22/install-opencv-3-0-and-python-2-7-on-ubuntu . I used python 2.7 on ubuntu 16.04 to run this project.
